# DevConnect

DevConnect is a **developer-centric social networking web application** built using the **MERN stack**.
It provides a single platform where developers and students can **create profiles, share technical content, connect with peers, collaborate on projects, and participate in real-time coding sessions**.

##  What This Project Is About

DevConnect aims to solve the problem of **fragmented developer platforms** by combining multiple developer-focused features into one application:

* Professional developer profiles
* Technical blogs and posts
* Developer networking and connections
* Developer-led job and collaboration opportunities
* Real-time collaborative coding using Socket.IO

This makes DevConnect a **one-stop platform for learning, networking, and collaboration**.
